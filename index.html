				<h2>Dachshund</h2>
				<p>
					Also known as the wiener dog, badger dog, or sausage dog, is a
					short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. They may be smooth,
					wire, or long-haired.
				</p>
				<p>
					The standard-sized dachshund was developed to scent, chase, and flush
					out badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals, while the miniature
					dachshund was bred to hunt small animals such as rabbits and mice.

				<h2>Corgi</h2>

					Cardigan Welsh Corgi.

				<h2>Mongrel</h2>
				<p>
					A mongrel, mutt or mixed-breed dog is a dog that does not belong to
					one officially recognized breed and is not the result of intentional
					breeding.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although mongrels are viewed as of less commercial value than
					intentionally bred dogs, they are thought to be less susceptible to
					genetic health problems associated with inbreeding.
