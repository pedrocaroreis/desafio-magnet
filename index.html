		<h2>Dachshund</h2>
		<p>
			Also known as the wiener dog, badger dog, or sausage dog, is a
			short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. They may be smooth, wire,
			or long-haired.
		</p>
		<p>
			The standard-sized dachshund was developed to scent, chase, and flush out
			badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals, while the miniature dachshund
			was bred to hunt small animals such as rabbits and mice.

		<h2>Mongrel</h2>
		<p>
			A mongrel, mutt or mixed-breed dog is a dog that does not belong to one
			officially recognized breed and is not the result of intentional breeding.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although mongrels are viewed as of less commercial value than
			intentionally bred dogs, they are thought to be less susceptible to
			genetic health problems associated with inbreeding.
